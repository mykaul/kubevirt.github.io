title: Virtual Machine Management for Kubernetes
---

The KubeVirt project aims to provide infrastructure and integration on top of
Kubernetes, to enable general purpose management of virtual machines using
[KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org) and [libvirt](https://libvirt.org). The vision
is for Kubernetes to be usable in either platform as a service or infrastructure
as a service scenarios. Instead of having to choose between
[OpenShift](https://openshift.com), [oVirt](https://ovirt.org)
and [OpenStack](https://openstack.org), users will have a single platform
providing a consistent approach to management for application containers, data
center full OS virtualization and cloud full OS virtualization.
